        1. If you request Always access, users will still get the chance to choose When In Use.
        2. If they choose Always, iOS will automatically ask them again after a few days to confirm they still want to grant Always access.
        3. When your app is using location data in the background the iOS UI will update to reflect that – users will know it’s happening.
        4. Users can, at any point, go into the settings app and change from Always down to When In Use.
